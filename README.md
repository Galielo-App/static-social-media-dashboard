## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- SCSS 
- Vite Bundler
- Mobile-first workflow 

### Continued development

I love Vite! For those who don't know, vite is an awesome bundler and you should take a look at it. Vite will clearly be my go to go next time i create a website/app without a framework (because for them i use webpack)
